# 🇪🇹 Digital Equb API

A modern, high-performance API for digitized traditional Ethiopian **Equb** (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations). This platform automates member vetting, payment verification via Chapa, and fair lottery draws, bringing trust and transparency to community finance.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime)
* **API Framework:** [tsoa](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/) (OpenAPI/Swagger-compliant controllers)
* **ORM:** [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (Type-safe SQL)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Payments:** [Chapa](https://chapa.co/) (Ethiopian Payment Gateway)
* **Validation:** TypeScript-first validation via tsoa

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Admin-Controlled Groups:** Creators act as admins to vet and approve member requests.
* **Search & Discovery:** Browse active Equbs by title or contribution amount.
* **Secure Join Requests:** Users request to join; Admins approve/reject via a dedicated dashboard.
* **Automated Payment Verification:** Integration with Chapa Webhooks for real-time payment confirmation (Telebirr, M-Pesa, Bank).
* **Fair Lottery Draw:** Randomized winner selection restricted to members who have paid their dues.
* **Automated Payouts:** Instant transfer of the "pot" to the winner's account (minus platform fees).

## 🔒 Security

    - Webhook Verification: All Chapa payment notifications are verified using an HMAC-SHA256 signature to prevent spoofing.

    - Ownership Middleware: Only the adminId of a group can trigger draws or modify group settings.

    - Decentralized Admin: There are no global roles; users are "admins" only for the groups they create.
